# lda_explorer

An application to explore the number of LDA topics in a corpus and show text and plots summarising the topics. It uses the functionality of the [consultations](https://github.com/DataS-DHSC/consultations) package. Very unfinished and WIP but I wanted it for myself to explore the number of topics.
